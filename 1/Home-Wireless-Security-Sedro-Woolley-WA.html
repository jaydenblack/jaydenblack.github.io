<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
