<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
