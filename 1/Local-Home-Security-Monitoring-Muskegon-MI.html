The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
