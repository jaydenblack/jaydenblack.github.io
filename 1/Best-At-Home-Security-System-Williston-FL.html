<p>Bullet cameras are one of the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinctive look. This appearance is recognizable to nearly everyone and therefore serves as a deterrent to undesirable people. The hope is intruders and crooks go somewhere else rather if security cameras are visible. That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism because of their apparent look. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires numerous cameras if a user requires to see several set views.

Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets groan, felines shriek, children cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
