And some cameras have special features that surpass those basics. Here are some typical features you'll come across while shopping and why they are necessary (we've noted them in alphabetical order).

Woot has also published great deals on wireless security systems in the past. It's a bit harder to plan your purchase when shopping at Woot, as the majority of the deals are only offered for 24-hours. Because of that, I advise that you bookmark the electronics tab and inspect back typically.

Catastrophe protection - you can link a z-wave smoke and carbon monoxide alarm to the app. Disadvantage: some systems have a high rate of incorrect alarms since some of these sensors might be too sensitive.
