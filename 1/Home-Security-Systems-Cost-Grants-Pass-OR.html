<p>There have actually long been well-established guidelines governing the audio recording of people without their consent (there is a reason surveillance cameras never ever have microphones).

But neither can tape continuously, and they both require the Ring Safeguard plan to capture recordings. Likewise, the wired version usually left gaps of up to 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to minimize incorrect signals.</p>
