You can even pair numerous cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But given that a lot of retail theft wouldn't journey an alarm anyway (an employee slipping some additional money while providing a client modification, for example), we think it's more important to have premium images so you have the evidence you need.

<p>At $24.99 per month, SimpliSafe's top-tier bundle is still very budget friendly compared to the other companies on this list. It's almost a steal.
