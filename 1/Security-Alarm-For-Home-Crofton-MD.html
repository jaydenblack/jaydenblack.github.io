<p>ALARM USER. Anyone, company, association or corporation of any kind in control of any building, structure or facility where an alarm is installed, run and preserved. In the case of an occupancy, the occupant will be considered the sole alarm user at the alarm site. The other major choice when selecting a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera.

Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
