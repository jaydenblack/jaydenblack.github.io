<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
