<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities permit you to use their sensors and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a model that offers a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for recorded video.

For that, you'll need a doorbell that utilizes pre-buffering to record the action happening before motion is found or the doorbell is pressed.</p>
