<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long variety circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>
