For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment this way to make consumers stick with them longer, since changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware.

<p>The real reason cameras are usually released is to minimize much pettier crimes. However it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not minimized criminal offense. "When the crime and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the basic downward pattern in offenses and crimes," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in particular categories however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre."

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
