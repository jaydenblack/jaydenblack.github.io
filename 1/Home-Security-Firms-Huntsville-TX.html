<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.

<p>Potential intruders by and large choose simpler targets with the least quantity of threat involved. Property owners also sometimes install phony security cameras using the exact same thinking.
