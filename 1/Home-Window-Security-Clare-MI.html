<p>We enjoy that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision choice, however the white and black version can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't actually a big deal thinking about the Argus 2's rate and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar energy with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
