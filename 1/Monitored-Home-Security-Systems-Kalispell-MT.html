<p>It is essential to know that the Brinks of yesteryear isn't the same company as the Brinks of today. The company went through a rebranding and renaming stage in 2009 as Broadview Security due to ownership modifications. However, MONI Smart Security got the name rights for Brinks and brought the original name back to market in 2018. MONI Smart Security has a history of customer care obstacles, but J.D. Power recently ranked Brinks # 1 in client satisfaction. You can find out more about particular choices and features that are readily available with the new Brinks in the following evaluation.</p>
<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is an extremely common type of two piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or usually closed when under the influence of a magnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which consists of a magnet. When the magnet is moved away from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, once again based on whether or not the style is typically open or normally closed. This action coupled with an electrical existing (typically at 12V DC) allows an alarm control board to spot a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are really typical and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can usually be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
