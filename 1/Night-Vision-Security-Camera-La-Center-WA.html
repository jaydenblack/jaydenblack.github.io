<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, signals, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Dome Cameras - discrete and vandal-proof cameras with a larger watching angle, perfect for inside or outside your home.

Professional alarm monitoring services do offer some nice functions that are not readily available if you choose to monitor the alarm system yourself.</p>

Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and supply physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to warrant authorities response.</p>

<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold occasion to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to start the heater at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might take a look at the entire location and talk to me about my concerns. He was professional, polite and extremely encouraging. The 2nd guard arrived in the middle of the night and took control of. When I arrived in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also professional, reassuring and considerate. We were very delighted with your service and I will recommend that we get in touch with your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
