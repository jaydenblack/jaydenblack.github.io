<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Suggestion: Often keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately switch off the heater.
