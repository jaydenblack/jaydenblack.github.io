<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment by doing this to make consumers stay with them longer, since changing monitoring companies means numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for clients. How did they do it? They placed five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their latest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't say which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>With connectivity less of a concern, wired security systems have actually typically been the very first option of market experts and companies based on reliable data security.
