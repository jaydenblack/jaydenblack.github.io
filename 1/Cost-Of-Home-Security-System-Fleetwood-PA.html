<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
