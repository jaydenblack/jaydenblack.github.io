We've discovered good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, however you'll find more than 30 brands offered. In some cases you do not have a choice. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use only expert installation. However most other companies on our best home security systems list provide you a Do It Yourself choice. ADT doesn't have the strongest customer support track record amongst the companies we thought about, racking up more than 3,000 complaints on its Better Business Bureau page While we chalked most of this up to the fact that ADT has a number of million more consumers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
