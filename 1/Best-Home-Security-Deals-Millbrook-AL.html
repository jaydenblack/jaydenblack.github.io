Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will reduce criminal activity and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I checked, consisting of clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
