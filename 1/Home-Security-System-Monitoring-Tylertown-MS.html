<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, nevertheless, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this review.
