As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
