We have actually discovered good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll find more than 30 brand names offered. Sometimes you do not have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT use just expert installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a DIY choice. ADT does not have the strongest customer care reputation among the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 complaints on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this up to the fact that ADT has a number of million more clients than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>
<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn indication monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company initially explored home security in 2011, and its signature red yard sign is nearly as common as ADT's classic blue.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
