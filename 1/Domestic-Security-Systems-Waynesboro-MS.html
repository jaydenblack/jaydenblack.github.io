<p>The majority of contemporary CCTV video surveillance systems include DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to browse archived video, and also allows users to stream video over a network for remote viewing from multiple locations. Frequently, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being damaged or harmed by the more figured out burglars. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they may also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
