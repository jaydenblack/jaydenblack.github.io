<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could measure up to some of our top picks.

Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
