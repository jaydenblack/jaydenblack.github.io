It can send you a mobile phone alert and conserve the footage for later watching if the camera captures video of something while you're away.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
