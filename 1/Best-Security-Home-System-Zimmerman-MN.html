<p>Discover how to create, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal offense. The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be touchy, with horrible night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was faulty, therefore we may revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you an excellent field of view, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
