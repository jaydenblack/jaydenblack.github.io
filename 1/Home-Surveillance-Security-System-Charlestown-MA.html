<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
