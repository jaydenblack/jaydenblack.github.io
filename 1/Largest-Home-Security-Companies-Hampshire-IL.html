Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to store and how long you prepare to keep recorded video. The video is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution.

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our testing-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
