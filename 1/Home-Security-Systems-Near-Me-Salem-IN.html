<h3>The Best Home Alarm System Salem IN 47167</h3>
<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments underwent prolonged surveillance.</p>
