Convenience is the major factor people change to wireless," says Du, and it's hard to argue against a 10-minute setup when the wired alternative requires expert installation of wires underneath your house. On the other hand, an alarm system that is professionally monitored streamlines this process. Moments after an alarm is triggered, a monitoring specialist checks in with you.

Wired alarm systems are very dependable and you do not have to stress over their battery running out.
