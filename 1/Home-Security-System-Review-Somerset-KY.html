Depending on the variation picked, it can be sensitive to various frequencies or levels of sound or vibration. The system is based on electro-magnetic or coaxial sensor cable television with the controller having the capability to distinguish in between signals from the cable television or chainwire being cut, an intruder climbing up the fence, or bad weather.</p>
