In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
