We believe burglar alarms work best when integrated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and access control.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof since it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
