<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.
