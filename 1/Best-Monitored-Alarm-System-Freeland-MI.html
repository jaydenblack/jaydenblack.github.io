<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
