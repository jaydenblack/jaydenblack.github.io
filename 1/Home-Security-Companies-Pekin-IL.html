<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.

Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
