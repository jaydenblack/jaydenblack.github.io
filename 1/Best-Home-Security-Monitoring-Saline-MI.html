<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's great, though.

These assessments can be super practical, but they can also offer you on a bunch of equipment you didn't believe you required (and probably still don't).
