<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm system, a number of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance provider provide discounts on insurance premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many cops departments provide numerous "totally free" false alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The deals of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing trend in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, because they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
