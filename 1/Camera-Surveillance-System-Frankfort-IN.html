<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed properties) a ineffective and expensive technique to break-in decrease across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You can use a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, however it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, meaning you will not be able to connect it directly to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate particular actions in the home.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
