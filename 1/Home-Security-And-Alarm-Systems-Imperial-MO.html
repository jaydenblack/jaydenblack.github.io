<p>As an inducement to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the very first few months. Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and a little less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments use a number of "free" incorrect alarms prior to imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting three or four free incorrect alarms per calendar year, since they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
