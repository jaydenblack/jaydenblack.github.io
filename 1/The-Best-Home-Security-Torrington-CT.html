<p>Thanks to recent advancements in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've made the decision to install an alarm system, you need to consider the following benefits of wireless innovation. For some, that might be worth the $300 price tag. But while we like the wise functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Cam IQ, a lot of the cameras we looked at deal the very same advantages at a more sensible rate. Handle your home no matter where you are with the Vivint Smart Home app. Use your mobile phone to speak and see with visitors at your door, see and protect packages, track activity with saved video, or engage with household in your home.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
