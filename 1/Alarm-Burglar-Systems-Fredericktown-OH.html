<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we checked, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.
