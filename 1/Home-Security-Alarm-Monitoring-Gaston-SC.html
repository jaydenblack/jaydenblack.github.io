<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge an infraction. Once a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
