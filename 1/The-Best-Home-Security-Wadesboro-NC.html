Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
