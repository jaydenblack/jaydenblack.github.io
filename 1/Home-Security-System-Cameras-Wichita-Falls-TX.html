<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and decrease crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a fantastic daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with horrible night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, and so we might review this evaluation. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera offers you an outstanding field of vision, and the photo you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
