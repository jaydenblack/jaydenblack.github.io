<p>GO2 offers full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Of course, the obvious downside to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be costly. If the system was not set up throughout the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to challenging spots that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise susceptible to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a failure, but long term outages will lead to the system losing power. It's also crucial to consider the length of time you plan to remain at the very same house when choosing a wired system. Since these security systems are incorporated into the home's wiring, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>

A few minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it just would not link. A help window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Certainly not perfect-- but the rep apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
