<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
