Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits wherever you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video to the cloud. The broad face of the camera offers you an impressive field of vision, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.)
