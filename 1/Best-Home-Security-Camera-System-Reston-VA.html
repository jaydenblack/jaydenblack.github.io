When purchasing a system online, understand that most of the time expert alarm companies will not install consumer purchased items! Why? Alarm companies do not understand if the bought items are utilized, do not work, or have compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Another way to save recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR).
