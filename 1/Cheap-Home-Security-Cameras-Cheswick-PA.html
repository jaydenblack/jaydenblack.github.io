Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic sound wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs howl, felines squeal, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
