<p>Flood lights are typically utilized in conjunction with motion detectors. When sensing units spot movement, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will enable you to see who is on your property and will possibly frighten intruders. Much better outdoor lighting also means a clearer video for any outside cameras you have. When selecting flood lights, consider the brightness and range the light shines. Flood lights can prevent vandals or scare them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your comfort than for home protection.</p>
