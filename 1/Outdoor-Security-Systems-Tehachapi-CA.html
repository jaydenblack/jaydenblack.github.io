<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a great alternative for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

The innovation gradually developed into the highly advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
