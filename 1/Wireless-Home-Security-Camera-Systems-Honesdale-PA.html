We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false signals). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have crucial fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>
