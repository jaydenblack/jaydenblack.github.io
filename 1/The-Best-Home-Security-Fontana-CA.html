Look at the ceiling of customer electronics shops and storage facility chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the typical consumer camera.

<p>Depending on the brand name and design alarm control board you own there might be a back entrance" into your panel's Program Mode if the Installer Code is not understood. Honeywell panels for example have an easy method to enter Program Mode if the code was forgotten or not provided. Others nevertheless need to be factory reset" meaning it eliminates all current setup (zones, passcodes, etc.) and imitates a new alarm panel out of the box.
