The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying an opportunity for the malicious opponent to tape-record these codes and utilize various cracking tools to evaluate security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "model" security key recorded during the network healing.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems normally consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's washroom.
