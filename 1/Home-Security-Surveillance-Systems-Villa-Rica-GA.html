The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
