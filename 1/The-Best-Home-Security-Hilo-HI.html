<p>Aside from the name, ADT also has a vast array of security equipment to protect your home.

<p>You can select from SimpliSafe's original acclaimed system or their most recent line of equipment. Both systems offer outstanding, dependable home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, however that greater cost features a system that is smaller, much faster, and stronger. At half the size of the initial system, the small sensors are virtually undetectable. The new system works 5 times quicker, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten burglars.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
