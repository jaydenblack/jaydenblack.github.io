<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
