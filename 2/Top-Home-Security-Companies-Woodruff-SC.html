<p>The 2nd main difference is the pricing. Wired systems can be notoriously pricey. Every element of the system will cost you cash. So, at the end, who's robbing who?

<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the very same smarts and more comprehensive 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , due to the fact that its image quality is still excellent, and it's a little better worth - though its rate is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the cash is all the typical Arlo traits in regards to the solid build quality, excellent camera video, tons of creative features and a polished app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
