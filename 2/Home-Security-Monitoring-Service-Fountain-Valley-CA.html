<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is needed for transferring video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the maker, rather of at your house) is the norm nowadays, but some cameras save recordings locally on a microSD card or a linked hard drive. Onboard storage is good, but it will not be of much aid if someone steals the camera. Hackers can gain control of wireless camera systems.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically do not come with in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
