<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
