I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I extremely advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for example. However, those features come at a relatively steep rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for one month of video history.
