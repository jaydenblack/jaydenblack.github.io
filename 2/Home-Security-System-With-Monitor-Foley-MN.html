Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
