<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.
