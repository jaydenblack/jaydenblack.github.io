During screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was found. We love that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
