<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, must provide a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of free cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month cost ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to correctly find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with taping spaces throughout crucial security occasions.
