<p>For smart home features, we advise the ADT Pulse bundle. It delivers full IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you remotely arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronics on and off, and control the thermostat so you never ever need to come home to a cold house. ADT also deals with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 careful people with mobile phones is much better security than one security individual viewing 10,000 people on CCTV.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
