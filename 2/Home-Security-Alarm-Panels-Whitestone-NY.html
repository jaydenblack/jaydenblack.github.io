<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The backbone of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home components in your house. Many connect to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular assistance, positioning is more flexible. Contact sensing units are the very first thing you ought to buy along with the base station; these attach to windows and doors and will inform you when they open.
