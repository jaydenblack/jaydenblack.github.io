<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots.

<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using numerous sensors to monitor activity in one area, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer. A second alarm signal-- received in a surrounding zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
