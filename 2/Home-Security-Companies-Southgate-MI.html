<p>Different types of CCTV cameras. While alarm system innovation has developed significantly since the 19th century, it is still based on the basic concepts innovated by Augustus Pope and Alexander Bell. All major alarm companies, including Mijac Alarm, utilize proximity sensing units in the windows and doors as the first line of defense against potential burglars, and alarm systems transmit info to a central monitoring station that can dispatch police rapidly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Basically, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and numerous detectors all linked to a main control board via radio signals. For example, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would need 2.79 terabytes of storage area for video footage, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>

Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
