<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to fix information after the reality, which suggests that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a lot of recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the hard drive area of 1080p to tape-record the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
