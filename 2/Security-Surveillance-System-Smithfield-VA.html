<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was invented for house owners. It must be installed by a professional alarm installation group and, as soon as set up, is difficult to move from one place to another. Wired systems are more common for big homes and are often more pricey than a wireless home security system. They can include outdoor cameras and an indoor camera much like the wireless system. In order to install the hardwired security system, the group will need to remodel the existing wires in your home. If you've already set up a wired system in the past and you are updating to a new system, the group will have the ability to reuse the existing wiring. However, if this is your first system, the alarm installation process can take upwards of 3 hours.</p>

When something triggers your alarm, your monitoring company will get the alert and after that alert the authorities for you. Looks like a much safer bet to us.</p>
