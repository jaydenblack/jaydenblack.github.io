<p>CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal worth.

The camera features a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription prepare for extra cloud storage.
