IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and at night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
