Like any intrusive innovation, the advantages of deploying public video cameras should be balanced against the dangers and costs. This innovation (a) has the prospective modification the core experience of going out in public in America due to the fact that of its chilling effect on people, (b) brings really real risks of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably secure us versus terrorism.

In addition to functioning as a deterrent, cameras can alert cops of criminal activities as they happen, which can allow officers to respond rapidly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at catching bad guys after they have committed a criminal offense, rather than being able to stop a crime in progress. Somebody has to be actively viewing the video screens for all 10,000 cameras if they are going to attempt to detect criminal activity before it happens. Having a large number of visible CCTV cameras in public locations might function as some level of deterrent, understanding you are being filmed, though most likely not watched.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.
