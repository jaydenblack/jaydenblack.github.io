<p>You might think you'll never be targeted, however why take the chance? An estimated 2,000,000 burglaries happen in the United States every year. Theft prevention is a needed precaution to guarantee the safety of your possessions. A burglar alarm can serve numerous functions to this end. In some cases, its existence can act as a deterrent-- burglars are less apt to target an area where it is most likely that they will experience such disturbance. In other situations, when they go through with the act, the alarm can serve to alert people in the location (in addition to the authorities) that something is awry. This makes sure a fast response and decreases the burglar's chances of success.</p>
