<p>No power? No worries. Wireless security systems work even if there is a power failure in the home. Wired systems can not run when an outage occurs, leaving the home unguarded. I have actually had their doorbell for a year - never ever an issue. And their cameras are better priced than any others. With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. Rugged Cameras builds security cameras for organisations of any size - from Mother & Pop shops to Fortune 500 markets.</p>
<p>The box-style camera is what most people think of when they think security camera." The most commonly-used security cameras, box-style cameras allow for excellent versatility in lens modification. While they are used most often, box-style cameras are not the most attractive. You might consider this style for outdoor areas or where style is not important in an indoor area. A lot of wireless home security service providers provide door and window sensing units that link to your control board. When someone enters your home, you'll instantly be notified.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
