<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself."
