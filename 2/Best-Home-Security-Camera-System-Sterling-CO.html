Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without altering its default user ID and password.</p>

<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they may be viewed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may find out to be mindful about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts." Indeed, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings went through prolonged surveillance.</p>
