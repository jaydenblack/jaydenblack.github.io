As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might discover to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, druggies or members."
