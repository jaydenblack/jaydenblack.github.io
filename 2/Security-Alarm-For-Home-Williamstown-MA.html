In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
