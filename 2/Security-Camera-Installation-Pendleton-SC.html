With a wireless system, you can also receive push notifications on your phone or tablet that let you know there is an issue, even when you're not in the house.</p>

Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control panel and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the four pointed out that uses a combination of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when making a decision.</p>
