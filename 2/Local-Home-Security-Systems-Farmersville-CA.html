<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
