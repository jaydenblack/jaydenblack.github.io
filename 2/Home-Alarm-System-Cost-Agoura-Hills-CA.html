<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation.

As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
