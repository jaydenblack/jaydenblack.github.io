Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities ability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and costly method to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
