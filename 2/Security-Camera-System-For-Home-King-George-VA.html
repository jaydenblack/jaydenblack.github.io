<p>Home security systems and modern smart home abilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensing units and cameras straight from your phone. Look for a design that offers a high resolution (1080p), a wide angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and affordable cloud storage for recorded video.
