Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
