<p>Just bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Fantastic clarity. I wanted to establish viewing on my cell phone but had a couple questions that the tech addressed with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company.

<h3>Wired Alarm System Ayer MA 01432</h3>
<p>Analog cameras have actually been around for several years and are still the most common type of CCTV camera installed today. They have basic functionality and store video onsite.

<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, however it means you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
