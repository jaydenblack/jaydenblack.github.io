<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of removing pricey incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the smart lights turn on to frighten possible robbers.</p>
