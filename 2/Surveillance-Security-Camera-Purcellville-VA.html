<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and lower crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has an excellent daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we may review this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud.
