"When the criminal offense and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the general downward pattern in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had lowered criminal activity overall in the city centre."
