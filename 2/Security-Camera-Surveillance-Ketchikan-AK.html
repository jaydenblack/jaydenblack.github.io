If the system was not set up during the homebuilding process, setting one up may require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also susceptible to power outages. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a blackout, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power.

<p>Canary has actually got over some initial software concerns to use a very decent security camera alternative: particularly that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion alerts (plus clear audio).
