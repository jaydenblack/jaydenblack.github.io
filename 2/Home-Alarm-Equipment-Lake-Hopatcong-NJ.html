It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership prepare for extra cloud storage.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
