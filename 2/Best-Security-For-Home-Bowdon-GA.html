<h3>Wireless House Alarm Bowdon GA 30108</h3>
<p>Best Expert Installation Security Company - While some security systems provide easy DIY installation, other companies provide (and in some cases require) expert installation. Professional installation is available for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>

Reception - The majority of reception areas in a business will be extremely trafficked, therefore an ideal place for a camera installation. Concealing a camera within a frame, clock, sprinkler head, or smoke detector could make a reception security camera more efficient, but be sure to talk to state laws regarding the legality of a concealed camera before doing so.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
