During testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was spotted. We enjoy that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get pricey. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
