<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a terrific security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Exceptional ranking for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget.

It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.

For somebody looking for a more intricate setup like home automation, or somebody that wants a trained professional to make the recommendation for the setup, specialist installation is a fantastic alternative. We've found that the majority of people that were anxious about self installing a home security system in fact ended up finding the procedure very easy. There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are understood to be particularly useful in this stage.</p>
