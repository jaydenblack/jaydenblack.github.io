<h3>Home Alarm Service Plymouth MI 48170</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest offender for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to advise as a top choice.</p>
<p>When the alarm company representative has made an appraisal of your security needs, ask him for a composed proposition and a copy of the agreement you will have to sign. Spend some time, look it over, and think of it. Inspect the alarm company's credibility by calling Better Business Bureau, or calling the Florida Department of Business Specialist Guideline or the Alarm Association of Florida. You need to also consider 2 additional estimates from reputable companies and compare costs.</p>
