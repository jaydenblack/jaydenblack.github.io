<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
