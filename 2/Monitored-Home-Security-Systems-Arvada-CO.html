<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the precise same way. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
