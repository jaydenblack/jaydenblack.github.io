<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers recognize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
