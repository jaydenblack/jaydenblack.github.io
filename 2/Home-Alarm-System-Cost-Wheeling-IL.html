<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
