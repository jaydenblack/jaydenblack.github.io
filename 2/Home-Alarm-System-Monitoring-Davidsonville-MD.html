When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer.

Nevertheless, to save that battery power, recordings max out at simply 10 seconds, with the system leaving a space of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
