<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the cops for an incorrect alarm. Considering that the property owner supervises of the system, cops are just contacted if there's a genuine emergency situation. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will get in touch with authorities if a property owner can't verify a false alarm. If  cops are gotten in touch with for a false alarm, property owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for false alarms and subsequent penalties.</p>
