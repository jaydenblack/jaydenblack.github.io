The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the fact, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and use up a great deal of tape-recording storage area. So much, in truth, that they need about four times the hard disk drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
