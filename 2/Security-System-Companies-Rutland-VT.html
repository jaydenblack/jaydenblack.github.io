If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers subsidize authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  method to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
