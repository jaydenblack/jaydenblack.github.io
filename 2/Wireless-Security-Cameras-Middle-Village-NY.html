That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty hectic with cool clever home features. We especially liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>

The technology is easy yet powerful. When the system is set and the magnets separate, the alarm alerts and sounds are sent.

<p>Analog security cameras transfer lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can handle such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR converts the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and then shops it on a disk drive for later retrieval. Displays can be connected to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
