Keep an eye on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or display screen and Chromecast or a TELEVISION with Chromecast built-in.</p>

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with innovative wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, including smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
