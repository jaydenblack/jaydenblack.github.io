<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops action to alarmed properties) a ineffective and costly approach to robbery decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
