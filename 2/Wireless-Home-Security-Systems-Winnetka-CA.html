<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
