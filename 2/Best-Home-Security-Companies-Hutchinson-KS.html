<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
