<p>When your camera are set up, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the central station. If you choose to have your cameras monitored (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered.

For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range concerns.</p>
