<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
