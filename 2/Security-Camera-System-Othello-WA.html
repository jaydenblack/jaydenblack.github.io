<p>This nifty smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we discovered it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was detected. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly.
