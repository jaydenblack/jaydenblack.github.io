In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can notify cops of criminal offenses as they take place, which can enable officers to respond quickly and effectively (La Vigne et al. 2011).

SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would alert users when it found any kind of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern.

You may even provide instructions on how to get into your building. As recently as ten years ago, consumers did not have access to innovation that let them manage their own home security systems.
