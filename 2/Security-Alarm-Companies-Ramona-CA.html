<p>Home security systems and modern smart home capabilities and compatibilities allow you to tap into their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone. Try to find a design that uses a high resolution (1080p), a large angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision range as much as 25 feet, and budget friendly cloud storage for tape-recorded video.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
