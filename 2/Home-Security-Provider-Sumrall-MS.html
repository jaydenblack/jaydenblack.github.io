<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it detects an intruder; a handy intercom function that allows the gadget to act as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.
