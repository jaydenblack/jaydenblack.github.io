False alarms are understood to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the police if they occur often enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>
