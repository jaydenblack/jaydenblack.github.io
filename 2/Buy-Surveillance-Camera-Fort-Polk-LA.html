<p>The real reason cameras are usually released is to reduce much pettier criminal activities. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that.

A 2005 study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the fear of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British federal government).</p>
